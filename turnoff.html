Hidden in his own office behind the medical wing, the sound of keyboards clacking filled the room as Dr. Ryu diligently worked on his research. Occasionally, he would pause to jot down notes in his worn leather notebook, the only physical evidence of his dedication to his work. 
<br><br>
Changwoo is staying up late yet again, despite knowing the negative impact it has on his health and productivity. He just can't seem to break the habit of procrastinating and leaving things until the last minute. Although he's far from a discovery of great importance that could potentially explain the factors responsible for the clones' unique abilities, Changwoo is determined to uncover the truth behind their powers. What is sleep, after all? Just a temporary escape from reality, a luxury that Changwoo believes he can't afford.
<br><br>

Clearly frustrated by the lack of answers, he sighed, feeling the weight of exhaustion settle in his bones knowing that he would have to push through another sleepless night in order to satisfy his curiosity. He glares at the screen in front of him, willing it to reveal the secrets he seeks. The glow of the monitor casts a harsh light on his determined expression, highlighting the intensity of his focus as he delves deeper into his research. But alas, the answers remain elusive, slipping through his grasp like sand through his fingers.<br><br>


He sighed, feeling defeated and frustrated at the lack of progress he had made, and leaned back into his chair. The weight of his exhaustion began to weigh heavily on his eyelids, tempting him to give in to the pull of sleep. However, it was then when he heard faint rustling and footsteps into the clinic. 
<br><br>

Glancing at the clock, he realized it was much later than he had anticipated. Or too early for whoever it is to be arriving. Curiosity piqued, he decided to investigate the source of the noise, hoping it might provide a much-needed distraction from his current predicament. Slowly rising from his chair, he made his way towards the door connecting his office to the clinic, preparing himself for whatever or whoever awaited on the other side. 
<br><br>

Leaning back against the doorframe, he strained to listen for any further sounds, his heart beating a little faster with anticipation. The clinic was supposed to be empty at this hour, so the unexpected presence of someone else was both unsettling and intriguing. 
<br><br>

That is until he notices a figure standing in the dimly lit room. He can't make out who it is, but the silhouette seems familiar. <br><br>


<b>"You should probably wait for Dr. Yang instead of me."</b> he smirked, amused by the unexpected visitor. <br><br>


Overseeing patients and treating them is mostly Yang's expertise, not his own. He's more of a behind-the-scenes kind of guy, handling the administrative and researching side of things. Most of the time, Changwoo is holed up in his lab conducting experiments and analyzing data. Sometimes, when Moe comes over to visit, Changwoo will take a break to catch up with him and discuss their latest findings for hours. Other times, Changwoo prefers to work alone in solitude for days, focusing on his research without any distractions.  <br><br>


As for direct patient care, he knows that his colleague's skills and experience are better suited for situations like this. 
<br><br>

<b>"But if you need painkillers, I can help with that,"</b> Changwoo offered,<b>"Just let me know and I'll make sure y,lou get what you need."</b>
